[![Install QA - install-snoopy.sh / install](https://github.com/a2o/snoopy/workflows/Install%20QA%20-%20install-snoopy.sh/badge.svg?branch=install)](https://github.com/a2o/snoopy/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Install+QA+-+install-snoopy.sh%22)

The fastest way to start using Snoopy is to execute the following commands (as root):
```shell
wget -O install-snoopy.sh https://github.com/a2o/snoopy/raw/install/install/install-snoopy.sh &&
chmod 755 install-snoopy.sh &&
./install-snoopy.sh stable
```
That is all.

Other installation options (i.e. installing latest development version from this
git repository) are described in the [doc/INSTALL.md](doc/INSTALL.md) document.
